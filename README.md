### What I learned

The hardest part of the project was getting the overlay color. I tried mulitple solutions I found online but they didnt work. The solution I found on stack overflow didnt work for me at first until I broke it down into a simpler form that I understand. Then I got it to work. Instead of min-height, I used width and height and it all work out.
